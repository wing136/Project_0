On the AssemblyJob side, you can find a function called calculateOperationPositions. 
I need to mobilize its 7 parameters: id, earliestPosition, LatestPosition, earliestTime, earliestPercentage, latestTime, latestPercentage, 
and put them in the file named Scheduling_test, and then Then perform the following actions (it has been decided that if the data is real numbers, the entire program can be run, but currently we need to fetch data from another file.)
